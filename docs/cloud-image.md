# Zega Cloud's Fly Machines image

`registry.fly.io/zega-g:latest` is the image Zega Cloud's control plane
(zegadb/cloud, `FlyMachines.create` in `src/machines/fly.ts`) runs one Fly
Machine of per Pro graph. The Dockerfile lives here, in zegadb/zega, because
the image is just the `zega-server` executable (crate `zega-cli`, `[[bin]] name =
"zega-server"`) with a
non-root entrypoint — no code that belongs to the control plane repo.

Build inputs, both fixed by the control plane's machine config
(`src/machines/fly.ts`) and not this Dockerfile's to choose:

- **Command**: Fly's `init.cmd` supplies the container's argv directly
  (replacing CMD, not ENTRYPOINT) —
  `zega-server start --host :: --port 8080 --data /data/zega --token-file
  /etc/zega/token`. `--token-file` is `zega-cli`'s existing flag
  (`zega-cli/src/main.rs`, `Command::Start`); nothing to add there.
- **Port**: `services[0].internal_port` is `8080`; the container must listen
  on `0.0.0.0`/`::` on that port, which `--host ::` on Linux's dual-stack
  default already satisfies.
- **Data**: the Fly volume is mounted at `/data`; `zega-server` is told to use
  `/data/zega` so the mount root itself (owned by Fly, not this image) is
  never written to directly.
- **Token**: Fly writes the per-graph token to `/etc/zega/token` as a file
  (`files: [{ guest_path: "/etc/zega/token", raw_value: base64(token) }]`)
  before the machine starts; `zega-server start --token-file` reads it. There is no
  environment variable in this path — `zega-server`'s rule is that product behaviour
  is configured by explicit flags/config, never env vars.
- **Health / auth**: `GET /health` (zega-server's existing route) requires
  the same bearer token as every other route
  (`zega-server/src/handlers.rs::authorized`) — 200 with the right
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, 401 with the wrong one or none. There is no
  separate unauthenticated health path; the control plane's `services[]`
  config does not (yet) declare a Fly-level `checks` entry, so this endpoint
  is for the router/operator, not Fly's own health checker.

## The executable was renamed `zega` -> `zega-server` (safe order)

The binary inside the image is `/usr/local/bin/zega-server` (it was
`/usr/local/bin/zega`). Nothing outside this repository names that path:
zegadb/cloud's machine config (`src/machines/fly.ts`, `init.cmd`) is only the
arguments `start --host :: --port 8080 --data /data/zega --token-file
/etc/zega/token`, and the image's ENTRYPOINT is `entrypoint.sh`, which `exec`s
the binary with whatever arguments it is given. The Dockerfile (the COPY) and
`entrypoint.sh` (the `exec`) change together in one image, so the image is
consistent with itself, and cloud's config works with the old image and the new
one. **There is therefore no ordering constraint between the image and
zegadb/cloud**, and no `zega` symlink is left in the image for compatibility.
The order that matters is only: build and push the image from a commit that has
both files changed (never edit one of them alone), then verify it with the
runbook below. Existing Fly machines keep running the image digest they were
created with; only machines created or updated after the push get the new one. Anything
that was running `fly ssh console` and typing `zega ...` inside a machine
uses `zega-server ...` after the next machine is created.

## Non-root and the Fly volume

The runtime stage is `debian:bookworm-slim`, not distroless: a **fresh** Fly
volume is mounted at `/data` owned `root:root 0755`
(community-documented: <https://community.fly.io/t/fly-volumes-getting-permission-denied/1773>),
so a non-root process cannot `mkdir /data/zega` on first boot. `entrypoint.sh`
starts as root (the container's default), `chown`s `/data` to the `zega`
user once (non-recursive — `zega` then owns everything it creates under
`/data`, so this stays O(1), not O(data size), on every restart), and then
uses `setpriv` (already in `bookworm-slim`, no extra package) to drop to
`zega` (uid 10001) before `exec`ing the real `zega-server` binary. The server itself
always runs as non-root; only the one-line ownership fixup runs as root.

## Build

```sh
cd <zegadb/zega checkout>   # repo root: the Dockerfile's build context
umask 022
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/.target" TMPDIR="$PWD/.tmp"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR" && chmod 700 "$TMPDIR"

docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -f docker/zega-g/Dockerfile \
  -t registry.fly.io/zega-g:latest .
```

`--locked --release -p zega-cli` inside the build stage matches the repo's
own release build (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, "Build CLI with embedded
explorer"); the Rust toolchain is pinned to `1.96.0`, the same version
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain` pins in that workflow.

## Push (Ava only — this is a credentialed step)

```sh
docker login registry.fly.io -u x --password-stdin   # Fly deploy token on stdin
docker push registry.fly.io/zega-g:latest
```

The Fly deploy token is a secret Sami provides; never paste it in a file,
chat or log (AGENTS.md §0.3). Building locally needs no credential — only the
push does.

## Verify locally (no Fly account needed)

Named Docker volumes, not host bind mounts: this is also closer to Fly's own
model (a Fly volume and a Fly `files` write are not host paths either), and
it sidesteps a Docker-Desktop/Colima quirk where a bind-mounted host
directory that the VM backend doesn't share comes up silently empty inside
the container.

```sh
cd <zegadb/zega checkout>   # repo root

docker volume create zega-g-verify-data
docker volume create zega-g-verify-secrets

# Seed the token file into the secrets volume (root:root; entrypoint.sh
# chowns it to `zega` at container start, same as it does for /data).
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh -v zega-g-verify-secrets:/etc/zega \
  registry.fly.io/zega-g:latest \
  -c 'printf %s test-token > /etc/zega/token && chmod 600 /etc/zega/token'

docker run -d --name zega-g-verify \
  -p 18080:8080 \
  -v zega-g-verify-data:/data \
  -v zega-g-verify-secrets:/etc/zega \
  registry.fly.io/zega-g:latest \
  start --host :: --port 8080 --data /data/zega --token-file /etc/zega/token

curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:18080/health \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer test-token'      # expect 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
                                              # expect 401 (no token)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18080/zql \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer test-token' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"schema":"type Person { name: String }","query":"{ Person { name } }"}'
                                              # expect 200

docker logs zega-g-verify
docker rm -f zega-g-verify
docker volume rm zega-g-verify-data zega-g-verify-secrets
```

The command line matches `FlyMachines.config()`'s `init.cmd` exactly (values
only, not the flags), so this is the same argv Fly hands the container in
production.

## CI

`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` builds this image (no push) on any PR
or push to `main` that touches `docker/zega-g/**` or the crates it packages
(`zega`, `zega-server`, `zega-cli`, `Cargo.lock`). It has no registry
credentials and is a build-only smoke check — it does not run or curl the
image; that stays a manual/Ava step until there is a reason to make it part
of CI (e.g. `docker run --rm` + curl in the same job, once caching makes the
extra minute cheap).
