//! zega#52: checkpoints. A disk database writes its whole graph as a `.graph`
//! file and starts its WAL over from there, so the log, and what a restart
//! replays, is bounded by the writes since the last checkpoint instead of
//! every write the database ever took.
//!
//! A checkpoint is an import of the database's own graph (APS 20: "land the
//! minimal snapshot-then-truncate now"). It uses the machinery `.graph`
//! imports already have, and adds no file or WAL entry of its own:
//!
//! 1. Under the graph lock, note where the WAL ends and encode the graph as a
//!    `.graph` file in one pass (`graph_file::write_unfinished`), into memory
//!    up to [`MEMORY_CAP`] and into its staging file in `graphs/` beyond it.
//!    Since every write appends to the WAL (and waits for it to be durable)
//!    under that same lock, the file holds exactly the log up to that byte.
//!    Everything that takes the lock waits for this step: writes, and reads
//!    too, since the graph has one lock. The pause grows with the graph.
//! 2. Without the lock: write what is in memory to the staging file, read it back for its digests, add its last
//!    section, sync it and rename it to `graphs/<sha256>.graph`, then sync
//!    the directory. Reads and writes carry on.
//! 3. [`Wal::rotate`]: write a new log holding one `ReplaceGraph` entry naming
//!    that file, followed by every entry written since step 1, sync it and
//!    rename it over `wal.bin`. That rename is the commit.
//! 4. Delete what no replay reads any more: earlier `.graph` files (imports
//!    and checkpoints) and a `snapshot.bin` from before checkpoints.
//!
//! Open replays from the last `ReplaceGraph` entry, so a crash at any step
//! opens to every acknowledged write: before the rename in step 3 the old log
//! is whole, and after it the new log's file is already durable. Open deletes
//! staging files, and `.graph` files only when the log names another one; it
//! refuses to open a log with no entries beside a `.graph` file (the log that
//! named it is lost) and promotes a whole `wal.rotate.tmp` found without a
//! log. `checkpoint_tests.rs` crashes at each step and deletes, empties and
//! renames the log.
//!
//! The first checkpoint marks the WAL version 3, as the first import does: a
//! zega from before `.graph` imports refuses the directory after it.
